- My story 
**I** will tell you my story so that you can understand it better. 
I started Masterbation at a very young age. Earlier , I thought it is a good practice and nothing is wrong in doing it. But , Young teens don't have that much of Maturity and intelligence as compared to Older teens of 16-17.
So I did it Every day. It became a habit. But as the time passed and I grew old and became mature I started to understand that I can't focus on my studies , I was weak and I had Low testosterone. So I tried to break the addiction. I tried [No-Fap](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/nofap-benefits) for 5 days then 1 week and Then I even completed The [No Nut Challenge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Nut_November) . But that was nut the end of addiction, I started the act again. But after NNN I started to feel Guilty whenever I masterbated. Doctors say that don't be guilty and Ashamed but The thing is that I should feel guilty. Because I can't even control myself, my desires and my mind and if I can't do that Then I not a man I am just a failure. Actually you should make guilt your power. Feel the guilt and make it your Ally. Because guilt has the power to get you unaddicted. Feel it and then do Semen retention and if there are any urges , face them like you are facing demons. Become Batman and face Joker.
